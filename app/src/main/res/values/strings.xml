    <string name="lorem_ipsum">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when
        an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It
        has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
        containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</string>
